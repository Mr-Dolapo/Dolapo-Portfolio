This Python script is a neat tool for translating between English text and Morse code, designed to be executed in the terminal. It leverages a comprehensive Morse code dictionary to facilitate precise conversions. Users can choose to encode text into Morse code or decode Morse code back into English through a user-friendly menu system. The script includes robust error handling to manage unsupported characters and invalid inputs, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience. This project demonstrates advanced skills in Python scripting, dictionary manipulation, user input processing, and effective error management.
